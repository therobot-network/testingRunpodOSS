Our caves team takes the unaged wheels and rubs them twice with Szechuan peppercorn-infused oil during their first two weeks of aging. The cheese develops a thin natural rind over four to six weeks of maturation—the bits of Szechuan peppercorn remain embedded in the rind. Szechuan peppercorns have been a prized ingredient in Sichuan, the southwestern Chinese province, for more than two millennia. Like black pepper, Szechuan peppercorn isn’t a pepper but a dried berry. Specifically, Szechuan peppercorns are the dried husks of berries from the prickly ash tree, a member of the citrus family. Szechuan peppercorns aren’t spicy in the traditional sense. Instead, they impart a tingly, numbing sensation to the mouth and tongue. Despite the amount of peppercorn in the rind of Szechuan Sheep, very little of the numbing sensation is detectable, but much of the peppercorns’ flavor remains—piney, floral, earthy, and citrusy. In Szechuan cuisine, Szechuan peppercorn is typically paired with chile for spice. Evoke that classic combination by pairing this cheese with Calabrese salami. About the maker At Murray’s Cheese Caves in Queens, New York, our experts age and mature cheeses to perfection, creating unique products that are exclusive to Murray’s. We built our caves to enhance the quality of our products, as well as to honor the craft of cheesemakers across the globe. The practice of aging cheese, known in French as affinage, was relatively rare in the United States when we built our first set of caves in 2004. The cheeses that mature in our caves are crafted in a variety of ways, which are reflected on their labels, described below. Cave Aged Original cheeses are produced from a Murray’s original recipe—we have a hand in every step of the cheesemaking process. Cave Aged Reserve cheeses are made in collaboration with some of our favorite cheesemakers. They send us unaged wheels, and we use unique aging techniques to produce something completely new. Cave Aged Limited cheeses are born out of our constant innovation and experimentation, only available for a limited time. Cheeses in the Cave Aged category are aged in our caves with methods that replicate the treatment they would’ve received from their original producer. This category is largely populated by bloomy rind cheeses that don’t fare well in transport. Murray's operates four caves, designed to ensure that each cheese matures in its ideal environment—the Bloomy Rind Cave, Natural Rind Cave, Washed Rind Cave, and Alpine Cave. The temperature, humidity, and microbial activity in each cave are controlled and monitored with the greatest precision."", 'source': {'data': {'base_url': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/dp/murray-s-cave-aged-limited-szechuan-sheep', 'description': ""Fragrant Szechuan peppercorns and rich Basque cheese.

On a trip to Switzerland, our buyers spoke with our Vacherin producer to see if we could get a few wheels to age in our New York City caves, and thus Cave Aged Vacherin Fribourgeois was born.

Contains: Milk Rind Contains: Colorant (Plain Caramel), Preservatie (Natamycin). Don Not Eat The Rind. More about Tomme de Brebis “Tomme” is a French word that refers to a type of natural rind wheel that’s small, round, and flat—a simple table cheese that’s often nutty and velvety on the palate. “Brebis” is French for sheep. The cheese is made from the milk of Lacaune sheep—the same milk this producer uses to make their classic Roquefort. Sheep give rich, high-fat milk that maintains its decadent texture whether soft or firm. Tomme de Brebis is a great gateway cheese for anyone skeptical about sheep’s milk—mild, buttery, sweet, and snackable, with enough flavor complexity to still appeal to more adventurous palates. Maker facts Family Owned Storage Tips When you receive your cheese, unpack the order and refrigerate the items. We recommend using the cheese paper we send most of our products in to store the cheese. The cheese paper helps cover the items and stop them from drying out, while also allowing the cheese to breathe. Since cheese is mold, it's a living thing! If you cut off air circulation to the cheese, you can actually cause it to suffocate and spoil at a faster rate."", 'source': {'data': {'base_url': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/dp/tomme-de-brebis', 'description': 'Tomme de Brebis is an approachable, snackable French sheep’s milk cheese with a sweetness that sets it apart and an enticing aroma of toasted nuts.', 'iconUrl': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/favicon.ico', 'og:description': 'Tomme de Brebis is an approachable, snackable French sheep’s milk cheese with a sweetness that sets it apart and an enticing aroma of toasted nuts.', 'og:title': ""Tomme de Brebis – a snackable French sheep’s milk cheese | Murray's Cheese"", 'sourceHeader': 'murrayscheese.com/dp/tomme-de-brebis', 'url': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/dp/tomme-de-brebis'}, 'description': 'Tomme de Brebis is an approachable, snackable French sheep’s milk cheese with a sweetness that sets it apart and an enticing aroma of toasted nuts.', 'iconUrl': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/favicon.ico', 'sourceHeader': 'murrayscheese.com/dp/tomme-de-brebis', 'title': ""Tomme de Brebis – a snackable French sheep’s milk cheese | Murray's Cheese"", 'url': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/dp/tomme-de-brebis'}}}, {'description': 'Summary: Aged sheep milk cheese, Tomme de Brebis, from France with sweet, nutty flavors and smooth texture.', 'metadata': {'content': 'Pasteurized Animal Rennet Age: 9 months Sheep Milk by Papillon France Approachable Adventurous Soft Hard In the realm of approachable sheep’s milk cheeses dominated by Manchego, Tomme de Brebis has a sweetness that sets it apart.

AOC stands for “Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée” or Controlled Designation of Origin. This label ensures that the food is made according to its traditions. It has to be produced in a certain region, according to specific processes, and packaged in a specific way. Comté has been made for more than one thousand years in the Jura mountains, on the French-Swiss border. The cheese is crafted from the milk of Montbéliarde cows from small farms that stretch across the Franche-Comté region. Storage tips When you receive your cheese, unpack the order and refrigerate the items. We recommend using the cheese paper we send most of our products in to store the cheese. The cheese paper helps cover the items and stop them from drying out, while also allowing the cheese to breathe. Since cheese is mold, it's a living thing! If you cut off air circulation to the cheese, you can actually cause it to suffocate and spoil at a faster rate. About the maker With deep roots in Poligny, France, at the foot of the Jura mountains, Fromageries Arnaud's operations date back to 1907. The original owner, Charles Arnaud, would park his truck in front of the famed Café de Flore in Paris in the 1930s. It was there that he came up with the name for his Comté—Juraflore. The business is now run by Jean-Charles Arnaud, Charles’ grandson. Their renowned Comté cheese get a taste of history, too. They're aged in the Fort des Rousses, France’s second-largest fortress, which was transformed into aging cellars in 1997. found in these collections and recipes add to cart The French Connection Fromage & Other French Favorites $140.00 / Gift Box price is $140.00 by Gift Box add to cart The Best of France Cheese Sampler Five Classic French Cheeses $95.00 / Each price is $95.00 by Each similar products Murray's Cave Aged Reserve Treeline Umami, Sour Cream, Springy / Cow Milk / Pasteurized / Age: 4 Months $24.00 / Lb price is $24.00 by Lb Murray’s 18 Month Comte Grilled Cheese A classic melt using our select aged Comte The Fall Favorites Cheese Board Cozy and savory seasonal pairings The Best Sellers Board Classic cheeses and bites from top makers around the world Flavors of France Board A feast of French Flavor inspired by our best-selling collection The Best of France Cheese Board Build a board using one of our best-selling collections Espresso Martini With Cheese Pairings\u200b A classic cocktail and the cheeses to enjoy with it.\u200b Pumpkin Spiked Latte With Cheese Pairings\u200b A cool, creamy cocktail that's oh-so autumnal\u200b Game Day Sliders For easy, hand-held sideline snacking\u200b Goat Cheese & Veggie Tart A bright and savory lunch treat The Cheese and Roses Board Fall in love with this collection of heavenly bites.

It was awarded AOC designation in 1991.

World of Murrays Our Story Murray's Cheese Caves Makers The Murray's Journal Find Your Cheese Quiz FAQ Guides & How To's DIY Cheeseboards & Recipes Vocabulary Careers at Murray's Cheese What Murray's Customers Are Saying Journal Behind the Rind All About Blue Cheese Behind the Rind MAR 12, 2024 Blue cheese is undoubtedly the most divisive type of cheese on the market.  Ask “Are you a blue cheese person?” and you’re bound to hear some strong feelings. Some people hate the intense spicy taste(which many in the blue cheese world call “Piquancy”), the strong flavors of the mold, and well, the blueness of blue cheese. For others, that is precisely the draw — blues are intensely flavored in ways that few other cheeses are, and for those who love that experience, little else compares. Medium: Murray’s Bleu D’Auvergne “ Think of this as a 'beginner’ blue cheese. With a wonderful flavor, and without the spiciness that a stronger Roquefort can have, it’s perfect to serve to people who 'don't like blue cheeses’ ” – Murray’s Customer Experience With roots in 19th century France, Bleu d'Auvergne is a sweeter take on the standard spicy blue. In the rolling green mountains of Auvergne, pasteurized cow’s milk is transformed into satisfyingly salty, silky cheese with subtle graham cracker sweetness and rich, mushroomy flavors. Bleu D'Auvergne was first developed in the mid-1850s by French cheesemaker Antoine Roussel. According to folklore, after a farmer sprinkled mold from his rye bread into a vat of fresh curd, Roussel created and perfected the recipe for Bleu D'Auvergne. Bleu D'Auvergne is often described as the milder cow’s milk version of Roquefort . We recommend serving it for dessert with some Astor Apiaries Raw Orange Blossom Honey and Piedras de Chocolate. Strong: Jasper Hill Farm Bayley Hazen Blue Now we’re getting serious about blue: the multi- award-winning Bayley Hazen Blue from Jasper Hill Farm in Vermont. This farmhouse blue’s presidential connections go beyond the 2014 White House dinner with French President François Hollande: Bayley Hazen shares its name with the Bayley Hazen Military Road, a supply route commissioned by George Washington during the Revolutionary War, located in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont. Thanks to its determined creators, the Kehler brothers, this Stilton- esque cylinder fulfills its duties. Expect a dry yet dense paste, and full of balanced chocolate, hazelnut, and licorice flavors. This cheese is definitely blue , with pleasant pepperiness and complexity, but its smooth paste mellows it considerably . One taste and you’ll know why it’s considered one of the best blues in America — one best paired with Hungry Bird Eats’ Nordic Crisps and Divina Sour Cherry Spread . Intense: Roquefort For the deep end of the spectrum, we look to the most classic, old world blue: Roquefort. Milk from Lacaune sheep is transformed into cheese and aged in the Combalou caves of Roquefort-sur- Soulzon to create the eponymous classic Roquefort cheese , a king among blues. For centuries, the cheese has been made in the small, southern French village, where its name and production methods have been protected since 1411. The creamy paste gives way to a spicy, peppery bite and earthy undertones thanks to the blue mold that penetrates the cheese. Roquefort’s heavenly flavor is reminiscent of the cavern air where the cheese ripens and the mold naturally grows, transforming the Lacaune ewe’s milk it’s made of. This variety is round, deep, and perfectly balanced: big, creamy chunks of the paste dissolve on the palate like sharp, soothing milky lozenges. Sweet and fudgy, it s linger is peppery and sometimes quite spicy. For serious blue cheese lovers, there’s no substitute. Contrast the savory richness of this cheese with a bright and tart pairing of Blenheim Apricots or something sweeter like pears and chocolate. There you have it, the definitive Murray’s guide to Blue Cheese. Whether you’re just looking to try a blue that you won’t hate, or you’re a passionate blue cheese lover who’s interested in expanding your blue horizons, we hope you’ve found some inspiration. As with any cheese family, the only way to know what you do or do not like is to taste, taste, taste. Now go out and get some blues! Blue cheese is undoubtedly the most divisive type of cheese on the market . Ask “Are you a blue ch eese p erson?” and you’re bound to hear some strong feelings. Some people hate the intense spicy taste ( which many in the blue cheese world call “Piquancy”), the strong flavors of the mold, and well, the blueness of blue cheese. For others, that is precisely the draw — blues are intensely flavored in ways that few other cheeses are, and for those who love that experience, little else compares. But wait, how does cheese become blue? B lue cheeses get their distinct blue veining from a mold called penicillium. Once penicillium is added to the cheese, wheels are punctured with a needle to allow air in and let the blue ribbons develop. Unlike other types of mold , the types of Penicillium used to produce blue cheese do not produce mycotoxins and are considered safe to consume. However, not all blue cheeses are the same, and that there is, in fact, an entire spectrum of blue cheese. You may have sworn off the blue stuff for being too pungent or salty, but maybe a more relaxed blue is the cheese you’ve been waiting to love all along. We like to say there’s a spectrum for all cheese, but especially for blue cheese: From Mild to Intense. So, what’s the perfect blue for you? Check out our guide below, which starts with the least intense blues to the most intense and includes our favorites at each level. Mild: Champignon Cambozola Black Label For those who want to dip their toe into the blue cheese world, we suggest starting with Champignon Cambozola Black Label . With just the slightest hint of blue veining, this is a mild, spreadable blue cheese unlike any other. The pasteurized cow’s milk cheese ripens slowly at a low temperature, allowing the paste to gradually break down and amplify its toasty, buttery taste and texture while also creating a unique triple-crème blue with a bloomy, gray-mold rind. Käserei Champignon was founded in 1908 in Heising, Germany. It was a collaboration between, cheesemaker Julius Hirschle and wholesaler Leopold Immler. Hirschle had perfected a Camembert with distinct aromas of fresh mushrooms and th ey called the cheese “Champignon Camembert,” and Käserei Champignon was born. A portmanteau of Camembert and Gorgonzola gives Cambozola its name, as it blends the creaminess and the Penicillium camemberti mold-ripened rind of the former with the tangy, blue flavor of the latter. Pasteurized cow’s milk is ripened slowly at low temperatures, building the complex, rich flavor that earns it “Black Label” status as it ages. We suggest pairing with a glass of champagne and Brooklyn Cured Sliced Smoked Beef Salami for a sweet and savory snack.

With a wonderful flavor, and without the spiciness that a stronger Roquefort can have, it’s perfect to serve to people who 'don't like blue cheeses’ ” – Murray’s Customer Experience With roots in 19th century France, Bleu d'Auvergne is a sweeter take on the standard spicy blue. In the rolling green mountains of Auvergne, pasteurized cow’s milk is transformed into satisfyingly salty, silky cheese with subtle graham cracker sweetness and rich, mushroomy flavors. Bleu D'Auvergne was first developed in the mid-1850s by French cheesemaker Antoine Roussel. According to folklore, after a farmer sprinkled mold from his rye bread into a vat of fresh curd, Roussel created and perfected the recipe for Bleu D'Auvergne. Bleu D'Auvergne is often described as the milder cow’s milk version of Roquefort . We recommend serving it for dessert with some Astor Apiaries Raw Orange Blossom Honey and Piedras de Chocolate. Strong: Jasper Hill Farm Bayley Hazen Blue Now we’re getting serious about blue: the multi- award-winning Bayley Hazen Blue from Jasper Hill Farm in Vermont. This farmhouse blue’s presidential connections go beyond the 2014 White House dinner with French President François Hollande: Bayley Hazen shares its name with the Bayley Hazen Military Road, a supply route commissioned by George Washington during the Revolutionary War, located in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont. Thanks to its determined creators, the Kehler brothers, this Stilton- esque cylinder fulfills its duties. Expect a dry yet dense paste, and full of balanced chocolate, hazelnut, and licorice flavors. This cheese is definitely blue , with pleasant pepperiness and complexity, but its smooth paste mellows it considerably . One taste and you’ll know why it’s considered one of the best blues in America — one best paired with Hungry Bird Eats’ Nordic Crisps and Divina Sour Cherry Spread . Intense: Roquefort For the deep end of the spectrum, we look to the most classic, old world blue: Roquefort. Milk from Lacaune sheep is transformed into cheese and aged in the Combalou caves of Roquefort-sur- Soulzon to create the eponymous classic Roquefort cheese , a king among blues. For centuries, the cheese has been made in the small, southern French village, where its name and production methods have been protected since 1411. The creamy paste gives way to a spicy, peppery bite and earthy undertones thanks to the blue mold that penetrates the cheese. Roquefort’s heavenly flavor is reminiscent of the cavern air where the cheese ripens and the mold naturally grows, transforming the Lacaune ewe’s milk it’s made of. This variety is round, deep, and perfectly balanced: big, creamy chunks of the paste dissolve on the palate like sharp, soothing milky lozenges. Sweet and fudgy, it s linger is peppery and sometimes quite spicy. For serious blue cheese lovers, there’s no substitute. Contrast the savory richness of this cheese with a bright and tart pairing of Blenheim Apricots or something sweeter like pears and chocolate. There you have it, the definitive Murray’s guide to Blue Cheese. Whether you’re just looking to try a blue that you won’t hate, or you’re a passionate blue cheese lover who’s interested in expanding your blue horizons, we hope you’ve found some inspiration. As with any cheese family, the only way to know what you do or do not like is to taste, taste, taste. Now go out and get some blues! Blue cheese is undoubtedly the most divisive type of cheese on the market . Ask “Are you a blue ch eese p erson?” and you’re bound to hear some strong feelings. Some people hate the intense spicy taste ( which many in the blue cheese world call “Piquancy”), the strong flavors of the mold, and well, the blueness of blue cheese. For others, that is precisely the draw — blues are intensely flavored in ways that few other cheeses are, and for those who love that experience, little else compares. But wait, how does cheese become blue? B lue cheeses get their distinct blue veining from a mold called penicillium. Once penicillium is added to the cheese, wheels are punctured with a needle to allow air in and let the blue ribbons develop. Unlike other types of mold , the types of Penicillium used to produce blue cheese do not produce mycotoxins and are considered safe to consume. However, not all blue cheeses are the same, and that there is, in fact, an entire spectrum of blue cheese. You may have sworn off the blue stuff for being too pungent or salty, but maybe a more relaxed blue is the cheese you’ve been waiting to love all along. We like to say there’s a spectrum for all cheese, but especially for blue cheese: From Mild to Intense. So, what’s the perfect blue for you? Check out our guide below, which starts with the least intense blues to the most intense and includes our favorites at each level. Mild: Champignon Cambozola Black Label For those who want to dip their toe into the blue cheese world, we suggest starting with Champignon Cambozola Black Label . With just the slightest hint of blue veining, this is a mild, spreadable blue cheese unlike any other. The pasteurized cow’s milk cheese ripens slowly at a low temperature, allowing the paste to gradually break down and amplify its toasty, buttery taste and texture while also creating a unique triple-crème blue with a bloomy, gray-mold rind. Käserei Champignon was founded in 1908 in Heising, Germany. It was a collaboration between, cheesemaker Julius Hirschle and wholesaler Leopold Immler. Hirschle had perfected a Camembert with distinct aromas of fresh mushrooms and th ey called the cheese “Champignon Camembert,” and Käserei Champignon was born. A portmanteau of Camembert and Gorgonzola gives Cambozola its name, as it blends the creaminess and the Penicillium camemberti mold-ripened rind of the former with the tangy, blue flavor of the latter. Pasteurized cow’s milk is ripened slowly at low temperatures, building the complex, rich flavor that earns it “Black Label” status as it ages. We suggest pairing with a glass of champagne and Brooklyn Cured Sliced Smoked Beef Salami for a sweet and savory snack.

With just the slightest hint of blue veining, this is a mild, spreadable blue cheese unlike any other. The pasteurized cow’s milk cheese ripens slowly at a low temperature, allowing the paste to gradually break down and amplify its toasty, buttery taste and texture while also creating a unique triple-crème blue with a bloomy, gray-mold rind. Käserei Champignon was founded in 1908 in Heising, Germany. It was a collaboration between, cheesemaker Julius Hirschle and wholesaler Leopold Immler. Hirschle had perfected a Camembert with distinct aromas of fresh mushrooms and th ey called the cheese “Champignon Camembert,” and Käserei Champignon was born. A portmanteau of Camembert and Gorgonzola gives Cambozola its name, as it blends the creaminess and the Penicillium camemberti mold-ripened rind of the former with the tangy, blue flavor of the latter. Pasteurized cow’s milk is ripened slowly at low temperatures, building the complex, rich flavor that earns it “Black Label” status as it ages.

What do they have in common? A bright white interior and often bright, tangy, lactic flavors (resulting from the capric acid in goat’s milk), although those notes can mellow out in more mature cheeses. The nuanced aromas of each variety can veer in different directions, from tart citrus to freshly baked bread. What’s clear is that goat cheeses are as delicious as they are diverse.

Halloumi : This traditional Greek favorite has been dubbed ‘The Grilling Cheese’ for its unique ability to resist melting at high temps. Its springy, meaty texture and lightly salty flavor make it perfect for serving up with olive oil and roasted veggies on a skewer. Try pan-searing it to get a crisp, mouthwatering exterior. NY State Yellow Cheddar : Crafted from the pasteurized cow’s milk of family farms in upstate New York, this classic cheddar is sweet, milky, and umami-packed, with a bright bite. It melts beautifully, so use it to top off a pan-roasted burger. Maple Leaf Pepper Jack : This American original incorporates fresh red and green jalapeno peppers, adding crunch and spice to the buttery, tangy jack cheese.

Raclette is a semi-soft cheese made from cow’s milk. It’s smooth and supple, with a brine-washed rind. It easily melts because of its moisture content, short aging process—after just three to four months it’s considered ripe—as well as its low potential for fat separation when gently heated. Raclette-style cheeses are produced beyond the Valais canton, including in France where this particular cheese was made for centuries before formal borders were ever drawn. Storage tips When you receive your cheese, unpack the order and refrigerate the items. We recommend using the cheese paper we send most of our products in to store the cheese. The cheese paper helps cover the items and stop them from drying out, while also allowing the cheese to breathe. Since cheese is mold, it's a living thing! If you cut off air circulation to the cheese, you can actually cause it to suffocate and spoil at a faster rate. found in these collections and recipes similar products Murray's Beer Cheese Mac And Cheese Rich, Umami, Mustard $32.00 / Each price is $32.00 by Each Award Winning Pulled Pork Mac & Cheese A smoky-sweet twist on the beloved classic Award Winning Pulled Pork Mac & Cheese A smoky-sweet twist on the beloved classic Raclette At Home A classic, simple melter for any occasion Murray’s Summer Fondue Grilled veggies with a cheesy dip The Grilled Cheese Pairings Board A cheesy sandwich spread for dipping Murray’s Deluxe Melt Three cheeses.

"What are your cheese shipping destinations, including restrictions for international orders?","Given the following text data extracted from a webpage, answer the user's request concisely based on the retrieved data shown below:

Data: [{'description': ""Murray's Cheese shipping guidelines with processing times, quality standards, and upgrading options for timely arrival."", 'metadata': {'content': ""Murray's Cheese takes a day to receive and process your order. We reserve the right to move orders based on item availability. Please remember that the delivery clock starts once the package is picked up from our location, not once the order is placed. Changes to orders must be requested at least 48 business hours prior to the ship date. Please review your order carefully. We take great care in cutting, preparing, and packing your order by hand to ship on the date you specify during checkout. Please allow plenty of time for your cheese to arrive at least a day ahead of any events or holidays to avoid added delays. (Ordering for arrival before to your event doesn't impact the quality of the cheese you receive, since your items can be safely refrigerated for about a week before enjoying.) Consider upgrading to 24-hour guaranteed Priority shipping for added peace of mind (and just $5 more) when timing is critical. Murray’s wants you to get the highest quality cheese in the freshest possible condition. We use state-of-the-art packaging; every order is packed in a thermal-lined box with reusable food-friendly gel packs to ensure quality standards for 48-72 hours. If the ice packs have melted, your cheese and charcuterie should be fine, they will just need to be refrigerated upon arrival. We have partnered with FedEx to track our customers' packages as they travel across the country, taking the most direct route to get our products to you as quickly as possible. You can always receive the latest updates on estimated arrival and track your order every step of the way by signing up for Delivery Manager at FedEx.com . If you have shipping related questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to us to consult by phone or email prior to placing your order.

To place an order for a custom gift, all you need to do is add the items you\'d like to your cart and then proceed to checkout. You can also use our Build Your Own Gift page. During checkout, after you enter a shipping address, you can select ""Is this a gift?"" and you will be able to enter a gift message, as well as sender and recipient information. What gift packaging options do you offer? For the protection of your cheeses and gourmet selections in transit, these items will be packed securely in our shipping carton. Items will not ship inside a tote bag if a tote is selected as part of the gift. If you purchase one of our Murray\'s Collections , we can pack that in our signature Murray\'s Cooler if you add it to your order. Do you offer gift cards? If so, how do they work? We do offer gift cards for amounts of $50, $100, $150, $200, $250, $300, $350, $400, $450, and $500. Our gift cards never expire, and they can be used at all of our retail and restaurant location in New York City, as well as on our site. Our digital gift cards will be sent via email within 30 minutes of purchase if same-day delivery is selected. For future delivery dates, gift cards will be sent by 7:30am ET on the selected delivery date. If you have any questions, please reach out to our customer service team via email, live chat, or phone. How do I know what information to enter when using a gift card to make a purchase? When using your gift card for an online purchase, add your gift card code in the box labeled ""Gift card number” in the PAYMENT stage of the checkout process. Are you Kosher? No. None of our locations are Kosher, so once we process Kosher items at our facility, the items are no longer considered Kosher. How should I store my cheese if I want it to last longer? We suggest our customers unpack the order and refrigerate the items immediately. We recommend using the cheese paper we send most of our products in to store the cheese (butcher paper or wax paper will also work). The cheese paper helps cover the items and stop them from drying out, while also allowing the cheese to breathe. Since cheese is mold, it\'s a living thing! If you cut off air circulation to the cheese, you can actually cause it to suffocate and spoil at a faster rate. Cheese is best stored in the bottom drawer or vegetable crisper in your fridge. In general, it’s better to buy small amounts of cheese for when you need it rather than trying to make a lot last a long time. While harder cheeses can stay fresh for up to two to three weeks when wrapped tightly and unopened, fresh style cheeses are best consumed within a few days of opening. If your fresh cheese is packed in olive oil or brine, store any leftovers in the liquid and follow package instructions. All cheeses and meats are perishables—by definition they degrade over time—so we encourage our customers to enjoy the cheese while it\'s in peak condition! Should I freeze my cheese if I want it to last longer? We don\'t recommend our customers freeze their cheese because it can result in degradation of texture and flavor. We like to tell our customers that they should finish the items they receive within the first two weeks so there is little time for the items to spoil. And check out this article from Martha Stewart where a member of our caves team discusses which cheeses can be frozen and in what circumstances. How do you source your products? At Murray\'s, we value traditional and established methods of cheese production, as well as new methods that challenge the status quo. From name-protected products to new organic items, we do our best to source diverse products that taste incredible and are safe for the environment. We try to expand our product base with these principles in mind to compile a product line that we can be proud of, not only for its flavor, but also for its effects on our planet. If you have a product that you think would be a good fit, send us an email at buying@murrayscheese.com . Please note that many of our products are imported from Europe and can show the European-style date format of ""dd/mm/yyyy"" vs the standard ""mm/dd/yyyy"" on products that are made in the US. If you have any questions on your order, please feel free to contact our Customer Experience team. If my cheese has mold, does that mean the cheese is bad? Not necessarily. White or blue mold that was not part of the original cheese indicates that the cheese has been exposed to oxygen, and the cheese can often be salvaged after removing the affected area. Some cheeses have natural mold on their rinds from the natural aging process of making the cheese. It\'s also common for cheeses that are wrapped in bark to accumulate mold on the wrapping material. Mold can also grow on the surface of harder, more aged cheeses during storage. This can usually be removed from the face of the cheese by scraping it off with the blunt side of a knife. Most of the time, cheese spoilage will be hard to miss. The most common sign is a bitter, ammoniated smell or flavor. Many people believe that if cheese develops mold then it must immediately be thrown out. While this is true for softer cheeses like ricotta, mold cannot pierce deeply into non-spreadable cheeses. You can remove mold from those cheeses with a knife or even a damp towel. You can find tutorials on Youtube or Google if you are unsure of how to proceed. Black, red, or pink mold usually indicates that the cheese has spoiled. If you see these indicators on a cheese you just received from us, please let us know as soon as possible, so we can address the problem. If you ever have any questions about the mold on your cheese, you can always send photos of the product to orders@murrayscheese.com, and we can have our product specialists take a look. How do special cuts and substitutions work? If you opt in to allow substitutions during checkout, and one of the items in your order is out of stock, a Murray\'s cheesemonger will add a similar item to replace it. If the replacement item is less expensive than the original item, you will only be charged the price of the replacement item. If the replacement item is more expensive than the original, we will only charge you for the price of the original item that is out of stock. If an item in your order is out of stock and you didn\'t opt in for subs, then we will send the order without the item that is out of stock. Substitutions may not be available for limited products or on sale products. *Note: We cannot provide substitutions on dropship items from Beecher\'s, Boomerang Bites, and Olympia Provisions if they are out of stock.

World of Murrays Our Story Murray's Cheese Caves Makers The Murray's Journal Find Your Cheese Quiz FAQ Guides & How To's DIY Cheeseboards & Recipes Vocabulary Careers at Murray's Cheese What Murray's Customers Are Saying Journal Hosting & Entertaining Keep These Cheeses: Favorites That Last in the Fridge Hosting & Entertaining APR 09, 2024 Making cheese last longer than a couple days is a delicate art, but we’re here with some useful tips to extend flavor and freshness. Want to keep your fridge stocked with Murray’s top selections? We’ve chosen our favorite long-lasting cheeses and charcuterie, and the kitchen essentials to keep them stored properly. What do all these items have in common? Their age. The longer cheeses (and meats) are aged, the lower their moisture content is, which usually results in a cheese with a firm, crumbly, or even dry, granular texture. Less water means less chance for spoilage, so when looking for cheeses that can stay tasty for a couple weeks (when properly stored), always go for\xa0hard cheeses\xa0and aged varieties. Parmigiano Reggiano This centuries-old Italian classic never goes out of style. Bright, fruity, and nutty, it’s ideal for grating over pastas or salad, or snacking on with a bite of deli meat or a smear of jam. When you’re finally finished with it, keep the rind! Parm rinds are known for adding some seriously rich savor when added to soups, broths, and stews. Roomano If you’ve never tried this extra-aged Gouda, now’s your chance. With notes of salted caramel and sweet butterscotch, it’s the ultimate crowd-pleaser, and a sweet alternative to traditional Dutch varieties. Aged for 3+ years, it’s got a delectably crunchy paste that makes for addictive snacking and is guaranteed to hold up in your refrigerator. Aged Cheddars When stocking up on cheese, cheddar is a go-to for many, but when thinking about longevity, try zeroing in on some popular aged selections–these ones will have a more flaky, crumbly texture and more depth of flavor, leaning towards savory rather than sweet. Some of our favorite aged cheddars?\xa0Milton Creamery Flory’s Truckle,\xa0Neal’s Yard Dairy Montgomery’s Cheddar, and\xa0Quicke’s Mature Cheddar.\xa0Try these in a salad, baked into a tart, or simply paired with a cracker. Salami Grab some meat to go with your cheese! Because charcuterie is cured, most varieties will last longer than any freshly cooked meat you’ve got, but a rustic salami chub is easily the hardiest. Naturally protected by a thick casing, a full salami can last in your fridge just as long as your favorite hard cheeses, making for a quick and easy snack that’s filled with rich and satisfying flavor. The Key to Keeping Cheese Longer: Bees Wax Wraps Our number one rule for storing cheese? Stay away from plastic bags and wraps. The trick to keeping things fresh is to allow the cheese to breathe a little–plastic wrap isn’t ideal because (aside from being hard on the environment) it dries out the remaining moisture in the cheese, which makes it lose its flavor and texture quickly. To keep your cheese in top condition, we love beeswax paper –its porous nature helps the cheese retain moisture and stay fresh, and it’s naturally sustainable.

The cheese is made from cow’s milk collected by a local cooperative of farmers that originated in 1960. The cheese spends five years aging, and during that time develops a dense, flaky texture that’s intensely nutty with subtle beef broth and umami flavors. Storage tips When you receive your cheese, unpack the order and refrigerate the items. We recommend using the cheese paper we send most of our products in to store the cheese. The cheese paper helps cover the items and stop them from drying out, while also allowing the cheese to breathe. Since cheese is mold, it's a living thing! If you cut off air circulation to the cheese, you can actually cause it to suffocate and spoil at a faster rate. found in these collections and recipes add to cart Decadent Gems A Taste of Ultimate Luxury $240.00 / Collection price is $240.00 by Collection Pairing Recommendations add to cart Murray's Prosciutto Di Parma Sea Salt, Rich, Stone Fruit / Age: 20 Months $14.00 / 3 oz Pack price is $14.00 by 3 oz Pack add to cart Pitted Italian Olive Mix Briny, Tender, Garlic $8.00 / 4.9 oz Cup price is $8.00 by 4.9 oz Cup add to cart Murray's Italian EVOO Subtly Nutty, Zesty, Pepper $28.00 / 750 ML Bottle price is $28.00 by 750 ML Bottle add to cart Murray's Prosciutto Di Parma Sea Salt, Rich, Stone Fruit / Age: 20 Months $14.00 / 3 oz Pack price is $14.00 by 3 oz Pack add to cart Pitted Italian Olive Mix Briny, Tender, Garlic $8.00 / 4.9 oz Cup price is $8.00 by 4.9 oz Cup add to cart Murray's Italian EVOO Subtly Nutty, Zesty, Pepper $28.00 / 750 ML Bottle price is $28.00 by 750 ML Bottle Share Take an Italian Cheese & Wine Pairing Class in NYC \u200b Get Tickets\u200b"", 'source': {'data': {'base_url': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/dp/parmigiano-reggiano-5-years', 'description': 'Rich in cheesemaking tradition and bold savory flavor, Parmigiano Reggiano 5 Years is dense and flaky and grates like a dream.', 'iconUrl': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/favicon.ico', 'og:description': 'Rich in cheesemaking tradition and bold savory flavor, Parmigiano Reggiano 5 Years is dense and flaky and grates like a dream.', 'og:title': ""Parmigiano Reggiano 5 Years – a bold, brothy parmesan cheese | Murray's Cheese"", 'sourceHeader': 'murrayscheese.com/dp/parmigiano-reggiano-5-years', 'url': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/dp/parmigiano-reggiano-5-years'}, 'description': 'Rich in cheesemaking tradition and bold savory flavor, Parmigiano Reggiano 5 Years is dense and flaky and grates like a dream.', 'iconUrl': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/favicon.ico', 'sourceHeader': 'murrayscheese.com/dp/parmigiano-reggiano-5-years', 'title': ""Parmigiano Reggiano 5 Years – a bold, brothy parmesan cheese | Murray's Cheese"", 'url': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/dp/parmigiano-reggiano-5-years'}}}, {'description': 'Promoting the versatility and longevity of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese for enhancing various dishes and recipes.', 'metadata': {'content': ""Why Choose Parmigiano Reggiano?

In order to be classified as a Piave cheese, the milk used must come from herds that water on its namesake river. The pasteurized cow’s milk used in this cheese comes primarily from three local breeds: ""la Bruna Italiana,"" ""la Pezzata Rossa Italiana,"" and ""la Frisona Italiana."" The cows spend the summers grazing on the mountain pastures, shifting to a mixture of forage grass, hay, whole grains, and corn when the weather shifts. Piave is often compared to a young Parmigiano Reggiano. It is smoother than Parmigiano Reggiano, with a concentrated, sweet crystalline paste that has a tropical fruit sweetness and slight almond bitterness. Murray’s Piave Vecchio—Italian for “old”—is aged for six months or more. It pairs well with both red and white wines, and can also be enjoyed with an amber ale.

Data: [{'description': 'Guide on cutting and serving different cheese types in various shapes and textures like a pro.', 'metadata': {'content': ""Murray’s Guides murray’s cut guide Crumbly Cheese Unique Shaped Cheese Round Cheese Block Cheese Wedge Cheese Salami & Pâté Wedge Cheese Wedges can be soft like blue or firmer like Idiazábal and Alpine cheeses. Whatever their texture, we have a step-by-step guide to cutting and serving wedges like a pro. Crumbly Cheese Unique Shaped Cheese Round Cheese Block Cheese Wedge Cheese Salami & Pâté Soft Wedges Cheeses included Roquefort Chiriboga Blue Gorgonzola Mountain For soft wedges of cheese, it's best to use a tool like a cheese harp or wire, as it'll create a smooth, even triangular cut. This is particularly useful for blues, as it won't pull the blue mold from the veins as a knife would. 1 Cut the triangular-shaped rind from the side of the wedge by using a cheese harp or cheese wire. 2 Continue to cut triangular wedges using the cheese harp or wire. Sometimes it helps to hold the wedge in your hand as you make the wire cuts (don't worry—the wire isn't sharp!). Larger Bloomy or Washed Rind Wedges Cheeses included Cypress Grove Humboldt Fog Murray's Brie Fermier von Trapp Family Farmstead Oma Murray's Cave Aged Reserve Cornelia For wedges cut from larger-format bloomy or washed rind cheeses with a soft or semi-soft texture, simply cut even slices from the side of the wedge. This will result in ideal pieces that can remain intact or be cut down into smaller bites. 1 Slice the wedge starting from either side where the paste is visible. 2 Portion the slice into smaller pieces with an equal rind-to-paste ratio. Triangular Wedges Cheeses included Sottocenere® Idiazábal Young Goat Gouda For firm but not crumbly wedges of cheese, long triangular slices are optimal, with each piece retaining a small piece of rind on one side. 1 If the wedge is thick, consider cutting it in half to 2 smaller triangular wedges. Lay it on its large, flat side and cut off one of the rind sides. 2 Make parallel cuts to create serving-size portions. Crumbly Blocks or Wedges Cheeses included Roomano Extra Aged Gouda Murray's Parmigiano Reggiano Neal's Yard Dairy Montgomery's Cheddar With firm, crumbly cheeses like Parmigiano Reggiano and certain Cheddars, the best approach is chunking off small pieces from the cheese block to create uneven, textured crumbles. 1 Start by placing the cheese wedge or block on the side that's large and flat. 2 Hold the cheese firmly with one hand. Insert your knife into the cheese vertically with the pointed side down (perpendicular to the cutting board) near the edge or tip of the cheese. Only insert your knife in part of the way—you don't want to go all the way through to the cutting board. Wiggle the knife until a large crumble pulls away. Repeat along the edge of the cheese until you get the desired amount. Alpine Wedges Cheeses included Scharfe Maxx Extra Alp Blossom Murray's Cave Aged Gruyère Big wedges of firm Alpine wheels are best served when sliced into equal-sized rectangular pieces with rind on both ends. 1 Make a perpendicular cut along the smallest edge of the cheese, cutting off the triangular end piece and removing it. 2 Continue to make perpendicular cuts, moving from the thinner section of the cheese to the thicker end, creating rectangular slices of cheese. The slices will get larger as you move into the thicker part of the cheese—they can be cut in half for size purposes. Each rectangular slice should have a piece of the rind on each end.

Want to keep your fridge stocked with Murray’s top selections? We’ve chosen our favorite long-lasting cheeses and charcuterie, and the kitchen essentials to keep them stored properly. What do all these items have in common? Their age. The longer cheeses (and meats) are aged, the lower their moisture content is, which usually results in a cheese with a firm, crumbly, or even dry, granular texture. Less water means less chance for spoilage, so when looking for cheeses that can stay tasty for a couple weeks (when properly stored), always go for\xa0hard cheeses\xa0and aged varieties. Parmigiano Reggiano This centuries-old Italian classic never goes out of style. Bright, fruity, and nutty, it’s ideal for grating over pastas or salad, or snacking on with a bite of deli meat or a smear of jam. When you’re finally finished with it, keep the rind! Parm rinds are known for adding some seriously rich savor when added to soups, broths, and stews. Roomano If you’ve never tried this extra-aged Gouda, now’s your chance. With notes of salted caramel and sweet butterscotch, it’s the ultimate crowd-pleaser, and a sweet alternative to traditional Dutch varieties. Aged for 3+ years, it’s got a delectably crunchy paste that makes for addictive snacking and is guaranteed to hold up in your refrigerator. Aged Cheddars When stocking up on cheese, cheddar is a go-to for many, but when thinking about longevity, try zeroing in on some popular aged selections–these ones will have a more flaky, crumbly texture and more depth of flavor, leaning towards savory rather than sweet. Some of our favorite aged cheddars?\xa0Milton Creamery Flory’s Truckle,\xa0Neal’s Yard Dairy Montgomery’s Cheddar, and\xa0Quicke’s Mature Cheddar.\xa0Try these in a salad, baked into a tart, or simply paired with a cracker. Salami Grab some meat to go with your cheese! Because charcuterie is cured, most varieties will last longer than any freshly cooked meat you’ve got, but a rustic salami chub is easily the hardiest. Naturally protected by a thick casing, a full salami can last in your fridge just as long as your favorite hard cheeses, making for a quick and easy snack that’s filled with rich and satisfying flavor. The Key to Keeping Cheese Longer: Bees Wax Wraps Our number one rule for storing cheese? Stay away from plastic bags and wraps. The trick to keeping things fresh is to allow the cheese to breathe a little–plastic wrap isn’t ideal because (aside from being hard on the environment) it dries out the remaining moisture in the cheese, which makes it lose its flavor and texture quickly. To keep your cheese in top condition, we love beeswax paper –its porous nature helps the cheese retain moisture and stay fresh, and it’s naturally sustainable.

You will receive a separate tracking number from Beecher\'s for your order. This cheese is the smoked version of Beecher’s Flagship, their signature cow’s milk cheese with a uniquely robust flavor. Flagship is made using the cheddaring process, and the cheesemakers add both cheddar and Gruyère cultures. The Gruyère cultures bring a distinct nuttiness to the cheese. Cheddar dates back to the Middle Ages, with origins in the village of Cheddar located in Somerset, England. The term cheddar refers not only to a style of cheese but also the process used to make it. Cheddaring is a technique where, after the curd is cooked and whey is drained, the curds are piled and cut into long slabs, which are turned and stacked over and over, consolidating and firming up as the rest of the whey drains. Smoked Flagship also works great melted into fondue or grated into scrambled eggs or atop pasta. About the maker In 2003, lifelong cheese lover Kurt Beecher Dammeier opened Beecher’s Handmade Cheese in Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. Visitors can watch their favorite cheeses come to life through Beecher’s glass-walled cheesemaking locations. Beecher’s uses traditional methods perfected by cheesemakers over thousands of years and crafts cheeses free of artificial ingredients and colors. The premium milk used to produce Beecher’s cheese contains no added rBST. From their signature Flagship cheese to extra-aged varieties, clothbound wheels to exciting flavored options, their products are as delicious as the fresh milk they’re made from, which comes from local farms.

It features an intensely creamy paste with notes of freshly churned butter, bright sea salt, and tangy sour cream. This approachable blue cheese is perfectly snackable on a Murray’s Sea Salt Cracker, and makes a dessert-like treat with a bite of a Pralus Milk Chocolate Infernal Bar. Read More “This blue is sure to convert anyone who's on the fence about blue cheese! Milky and mild, it's more tangy than it is spicy, with a buttery and bright flavor profile that's perfect with a buttery biscuit like Effie’s Oatcakes, a drizzle of caramel, and even a chunk of dark chocolate.” Murray’s Marketing Team – New York, NY Ingredients Pasteurized Cow's Milk, Salt, Culture, Penicillum Roqueforti, Microbial Rennet Allergens : Milk More about Murray's Dansk Blue Murray’s Dansk Blue is our version of Danablu or Danish Blue. Danish Blue, created in the 20th century by cheesemaker Marius Boel, was intended to mimic traditional Roquefort style blues. Traditionally, copper wires or rods were used to pierce the Danablu cheese. The milk used to make this cheese is sourced from a dairy cooperative located on Bornholm Island. The cooperative, a collective of 44 island farmers, currently bottles milk and produces cheese. This is the island's only dairy and they produce cheese, milk and butter for everyone on the island. Storage tips Harder blue cheeses can stay fresh for up to two to three weeks in a crisper drawer when wrapped tightly and unopened, while softer blues may start to dry out after approximately two weeks. The best thing to do is keep the cheese in one of your refrigerator drawers or the vegetable bin; this will help to keep your cheese from drying out. Additionally, we recommend wrapping your blue cheese in aluminum foil. All cheeses and meats are perishables—by definition they degrade over time—so we encourage our customers to enjoy the cheese while it's in peak condition!

In the case of Manchego, each ewe averages just 26 gallons of milk per year. The nutty, granular paste is encased in a rind that’s distinct in its cross-hatch pattern. Traditionally, the curds were pressed into braided esparto grass baskets, leaving the distinct cross-hatch design on the rind.

In 1984, Manchego earned Denominación de Origen (or ""DO,"" meaning designation of origin) status to protect its integrity and tradition. For a cheese to be classified as Manchego, it must be made exclusively from the whole milk of Manchega ewes, it must come from La Mancha, and it must be aged in natural caves for at least two months. Murray’s Young Manchego distinguishes itself from more aged versions with its mild, supple paste punctuated by a lacy network of openings.

Murray’s National Team – New York, NY Ingredients Organic Cow\'s Milk, Cream, Salt, Culture, Enzymes (non-GMO Vegetable Rennet) Allergens : Milk More about Champlain Valley Creamery Organic Cream Cheese This versatile cream cheese works for sweet and savory recipes, from cheesecake and cheese Danishes to creamy spinach and artichoke dip and fancy toasts with trout roe and radish. Cream cheese is a fresh cheese made when lactic acid is added to pasteurized milk and cream, which lowers the mixture\'s pH and helps it form curds. When the curds are heated, cream cheese is created. Storage tips While harder cheeses can stay fresh for up to two to three weeks when wrapped tightly and unopened, fresh style cheeses are best consumed within a few days. The best thing to do is to keep the cheese in one of your refrigerator drawers or the vegetable bin; this will help to keep your cheese from drying out. If your cheese is packed in olive oil or brine, store any leftovers in the liquid and follow package instructions. All cheeses and meats are perishables—by definition they degrade over time—so we encourage our customers to enjoy the cheese while it\'s in peak condition!

An excellent cheese board option, pair it with a pilsner.” Murray’s Marketing Team – New York, NY Ingredients Cultured Raw Cow's Milk, Salt, Animal Rennet Allergens : Milk More about Meadow Creek Extra-Aged Appalachian The cow breeds that produce the milk used to make Extra-Aged Appalachian are Normande, Tarentaise, and Jersey. This aged version is a spin on Meadow Creek Dairy’s very first cheese, Appalachian, which was made to showcase the flavors of the milk produced by their cows that grazed on the mountainous terrain. Regular Appalachian is aged only three months. The extra five months give the cheese more time to develop its layers of flavors. About the maker Located in the mountains of Southwest Virginia, Meadow Creek Dairy prides itself on being one of few producers who follows a true seasonal production schedule. The Feete family (the farm’s owners) makes their hand-crafted artisan cheese from March to December. Christmas Eve marks the end of the season, and the herd rests during the winter months. The cattle are never confined, grazing on native grasses and legumes, supplemented with some grains, salt, and Norwegian kelp. Meadow Creek practices year-round rotational grazing, and the herd is moved from grazed pastures to fresh ones to allow the grass to regrow. The grass is free of herbicides and pesticides, and their grazing methods promoted sustainability and health both for their lands and their animals. found in these collections and recipes The Après Ski Board Bold eats for snacking off the slopes The Campfire Cheese Board Savory pairings for sweet s’mores Pairing Recommendations add to cart Murray's Sea Salt Crackers Salty, Light, Buttery $8.00 / 4 oz Box price is $8.00 by 4 oz Box add to cart Murray's Wild Blueberries Preserves Lemon, Citrus, Bright $8.00 / 10 oz Jar price is $8.00 by 10 oz Jar add to cart Dufour Gourmet Pâté de Campagne Rich, Herby, Rustic $23.00 / 225g Loaf price is $23.00 by 225g Loaf add to cart Murray's Sea Salt Crackers Salty, Light, Buttery $8.00 / 4 oz Box price is $8.00 by 4 oz Box add to cart Murray's Wild Blueberries Preserves Lemon, Citrus, Bright $8.00 / 10 oz Jar price is $8.00 by 10 oz Jar add to cart Dufour Gourmet Pâté de Campagne Rich, Herby, Rustic $23.00 / 225g Loaf price is $23.00 by 225g Loaf Share"", 'source': {'data': {'base_url': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/dp/meadow-creek-extra-aged-appalachian', 'description': 'The more mature version of Meadow Creek Dairy’s very first cheese, Extra Aged Appalachian is velvety and earthy with notes of toasted butter.', 'iconUrl': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/favicon.ico', 'og:description': 'The more mature version of Meadow Creek Dairy’s very first cheese, Extra Aged Appalachian is velvety and earthy with notes of toasted butter.', 'og:title': ""Meadow Creek Extra Aged Appalachian – an earthy, firm cheese | Murray's Cheese"", 'sourceHeader': 'murrayscheese.com/dp/meadow-creek-extra-aged-appalachian', 'url': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/dp/meadow-creek-extra-aged-appalachian'}, 'description': 'The more mature version of Meadow Creek Dairy’s very first cheese, Extra Aged Appalachian is velvety and earthy with notes of toasted butter.', 'iconUrl': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/favicon.ico', 'sourceHeader': 'murrayscheese.com/dp/meadow-creek-extra-aged-appalachian', 'title': ""Meadow Creek Extra Aged Appalachian – an earthy, firm cheese | Murray's Cheese"", 'url': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/dp/meadow-creek-extra-aged-appalachian'}}}]

Want to keep your fridge stocked with Murray’s top selections? We’ve chosen our favorite long-lasting cheeses and charcuterie, and the kitchen essentials to keep them stored properly. What do all these items have in common? Their age. The longer cheeses (and meats) are aged, the lower their moisture content is, which usually results in a cheese with a firm, crumbly, or even dry, granular texture. Less water means less chance for spoilage, so when looking for cheeses that can stay tasty for a couple weeks (when properly stored), always go for\xa0hard cheeses\xa0and aged varieties. Parmigiano Reggiano This centuries-old Italian classic never goes out of style. Bright, fruity, and nutty, it’s ideal for grating over pastas or salad, or snacking on with a bite of deli meat or a smear of jam. When you’re finally finished with it, keep the rind! Parm rinds are known for adding some seriously rich savor when added to soups, broths, and stews. Roomano If you’ve never tried this extra-aged Gouda, now’s your chance. With notes of salted caramel and sweet butterscotch, it’s the ultimate crowd-pleaser, and a sweet alternative to traditional Dutch varieties. Aged for 3+ years, it’s got a delectably crunchy paste that makes for addictive snacking and is guaranteed to hold up in your refrigerator. Aged Cheddars When stocking up on cheese, cheddar is a go-to for many, but when thinking about longevity, try zeroing in on some popular aged selections–these ones will have a more flaky, crumbly texture and more depth of flavor, leaning towards savory rather than sweet. Some of our favorite aged cheddars?\xa0Milton Creamery Flory’s Truckle,\xa0Neal’s Yard Dairy Montgomery’s Cheddar, and\xa0Quicke’s Mature Cheddar.\xa0Try these in a salad, baked into a tart, or simply paired with a cracker. Salami Grab some meat to go with your cheese! Because charcuterie is cured, most varieties will last longer than any freshly cooked meat you’ve got, but a rustic salami chub is easily the hardiest. Naturally protected by a thick casing, a full salami can last in your fridge just as long as your favorite hard cheeses, making for a quick and easy snack that’s filled with rich and satisfying flavor. The Key to Keeping Cheese Longer: Bees Wax Wraps Our number one rule for storing cheese? Stay away from plastic bags and wraps. The trick to keeping things fresh is to allow the cheese to breathe a little–plastic wrap isn’t ideal because (aside from being hard on the environment) it dries out the remaining moisture in the cheese, which makes it lose its flavor and texture quickly. To keep your cheese in top condition, we love beeswax paper –its porous nature helps the cheese retain moisture and stay fresh, and it’s naturally sustainable.

We recommend using the cheese paper we send most of our products in to store the cheese, or our specialty Cheese Paper Bags . The cheese paper helps cover the items and stop them from drying out, while also allowing the cheese to breathe. Butcher paper or wax paper will also work! Since cheese ripens over time through its relationship with bacteria, yeast, and mold, it's a living thing! If you cut off air circulation to the cheese, you can actually cause it to suffocate and spoil at a faster rate. Harder cheeses can stay fresh for up to 2-3 weeks in a crisper drawer when wrapped tightly and unopened, while softer cheeses may start to dry out after approximately 2 weeks. Mold can also grow on the surface of firmer, aged cheeses during storage. White/blue mold indicates a cheese that’s benefited from some exposure to oxygen, and the cheese can be enjoyed after simply scraping the mold away with a knife. Most cheeses have mold on their rind from the natural aging process – mold is an essential ingredient, whose enzymes break down proteins and release delicious flavor! . It is common for cheeses that are wrapped in bark to accumulate mold on the wrapping material. Some black, red, or pink mold on the rind of a cheese is also common in the ageing process, but extensive molding in these colors, or mold that penetrates throughout the paste of a cheese may be an indication of spoilage. If you ever have any questions about the mold on your cheese, you can always send photos of the product to orders@murrayscheese.com and we can have our cheesemongers take a look! We do not recommend freezing cheese as it damages the cellular integrity of the cheese. This process especially damages the texture of cheeses often making them mushy, watery, or rubbery. Remember to always take your cheese out of the fridge one hour prior to serving, to allow its flavors to deepen by coming to room temperature!"", 'source': {'data': {'base_url': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/wom/holiday-tips-and-faqs', 'description': 'Answers to all your questions about holiday shipping, delivery, products, and more.', 'iconUrl': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/favicon.ico', 'og:description': 'Answers to all your questions about holiday shipping, delivery, products, and more.', 'og:title': ""Holiday Tips & FAQs | Murray's Cheese"", 'sourceHeader': 'murrayscheese.com/wom/holiday-tips-and-faqs', 'url': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/wom/holiday-tips-and-faqs'}, 'description': 'Answers to all your questions about holiday shipping, delivery, products, and more.', 'iconUrl': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/favicon.ico', 'sourceHeader': 'murrayscheese.com/wom/holiday-tips-and-faqs', 'title': ""Holiday Tips & FAQs | Murray's Cheese"", 'url': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/wom/holiday-tips-and-faqs'}}}]

For melting over burgers, incorporating into mac and cheese, or sprinkling over nachos, turn to supple cheeses that are high in moisture—think Italian fontina, mozzarella, or Gruyère. To make toasty cheese the star of your next dish, no bread or chips required, choose a firm cheese like halloumi that holds up to the heat of grilling or pan-frying.

With almost twice the fat content of cow’s milk, the buffalo milk used to create this cheese gives it a thick, creamy texture with a springy bounce and sweet taste. Try it on pizza, use it in a Caprese salad, or drizzle with some balsamic vinegar and serve on a charcuterie board with Prosciutto di Parma and marinated sundried tomatoes. Read More “Nothing tastes more like summer to me than Murray’s Buffalo Mozzarella. Sweet and bright, it has a flavor like lemon cheesecake. If you are looking for a fun but comfortable departure from cow's milk mozzarella, this is for you. I love this sliced up in a fresh watermelon and mint salad, next to a French 75 cocktail.” Murray’s Cheesemonger – New York, NY Ingredients Buffalo Milk, Cultures, Rennet, Citric Acid, Salt Allergens : Milk More about Murray's Buffalo Mozzarella 8oz With nearly double the fat content of cow’s milk, buffalo milk creates the creamy, luscious base used in Murray’s Buffalo Mozzarella. The cheese is made using milk from Asian water buffalo rather than American bison. The Asian water buffalo were brought to Italy centuries ago for the purpose of plowing rice fields. Fresh cheeses like Murray’s Buffalo Mozzarella have a shorter shelf-life than other cheeses, and should be eaten shortly after purchasing to enjoy their flavor at its peak. The milk use in the cheese is imported from Italy but made locally—shortening the time from make to table so it can be enjoyed at peak freshness. Storage tips While harder cheeses can stay fresh for up to two to three weeks when wrapped tightly and unopened, fresh style cheeses are best consumed within a few days. The best thing to do is to keep the cheese in one of your refrigerator drawers or the vegetable bin; this will help to keep your cheese from drying out. If your cheese is packed in olive oil or brine, store any leftovers in the liquid and follow package instructions. All cheeses and meats are perishables—by definition they degrade over time—so we encourage our customers to enjoy the cheese while it's in peak condition!

This rindless double-crème cheese is made with Jersey cow's milk and cream from Dutch Hollow Farms just outside of Albany, New York. The butterfat richness and slight lactic tang of the milk shines through, and the result is deliciously elegant. Enjoy with Murray's Heirloom Apple Butter and Redondo Iglesias Jamon Serrano, with a glass of something bubbly to cut through the decadence. Dropship items are excluded from our substitutions policy. Read More “Dulcet is such a great cheese for snacking on with whatever fruit is in season, a perfect balance of rich dairy and fresh sweetness. I go for strawberries in summer and apples in the fall.” Murray’s Merchandising – New York, NY Ingredients Pasteurized Cow's Milk, Salt, Culture, Enzymes More about Beecher's Handmade Cheese Dulcet Through our partnership, Beecher's orders will be shipped from an alternate facility outside of Murray’s. You will receive a separate tracking number from Beecher's for your order. This is a double-crème cheese, meaning cream is added during the production process to reach the required 60% butterfat. Butterfat content in cheese is measured as a percentage of fat in dry matter, indicating that 60-75% of the solids in a double-crème cheese are butterfat. While it’s a luscious choice for snacking, this cheese also melts well, so add it to your mac and cheese or grilled cheese for a bit of added richness. About the maker In 2003, lifelong cheese lover Kurt Beecher Dammeier opened Beecher’s Handmade Cheese in Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. Visitors can watch their favorite cheeses come to life through Beecher’s glass-walled cheesemaking locations. Beecher’s uses traditional methods perfected by cheesemakers over thousands of years and crafts cheeses free of artificial ingredients and colors. The premium milk used to produce Beecher’s cheese contains no added rBST. From their signature Flagship cheese to extra-aged varieties, clothbound wheels to exciting flavored options, their products are as delicious as the fresh milk they’re made from, which comes from local farms.

We recommend using the cheese paper we send most of our products in to store the cheese, or our specialty Cheese Paper Bags . The cheese paper helps cover the items and stop them from drying out, while also allowing the cheese to breathe. Butcher paper or wax paper will also work! Since cheese ripens over time through its relationship with bacteria, yeast, and mold, it's a living thing! If you cut off air circulation to the cheese, you can actually cause it to suffocate and spoil at a faster rate. Harder cheeses can stay fresh for up to 2-3 weeks in a crisper drawer when wrapped tightly and unopened, while softer cheeses may start to dry out after approximately 2 weeks. Mold can also grow on the surface of firmer, aged cheeses during storage. White/blue mold indicates a cheese that’s benefited from some exposure to oxygen, and the cheese can be enjoyed after simply scraping the mold away with a knife. Most cheeses have mold on their rind from the natural aging process – mold is an essential ingredient, whose enzymes break down proteins and release delicious flavor! . It is common for cheeses that are wrapped in bark to accumulate mold on the wrapping material. Some black, red, or pink mold on the rind of a cheese is also common in the ageing process, but extensive molding in these colors, or mold that penetrates throughout the paste of a cheese may be an indication of spoilage. If you ever have any questions about the mold on your cheese, you can always send photos of the product to orders@murrayscheese.com and we can have our cheesemongers take a look! We do not recommend freezing cheese as it damages the cellular integrity of the cheese. This process especially damages the texture of cheeses often making them mushy, watery, or rubbery. Remember to always take your cheese out of the fridge one hour prior to serving, to allow its flavors to deepen by coming to room temperature!"", 'source': {'data': {'base_url': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/wom/holiday-tips-and-faqs', 'description': 'Answers to all your questions about holiday shipping, delivery, products, and more.', 'iconUrl': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/favicon.ico', 'og:description': 'Answers to all your questions about holiday shipping, delivery, products, and more.', 'og:title': ""Holiday Tips & FAQs | Murray's Cheese"", 'sourceHeader': 'murrayscheese.com/wom/holiday-tips-and-faqs', 'url': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/wom/holiday-tips-and-faqs'}, 'description': 'Answers to all your questions about holiday shipping, delivery, products, and more.', 'iconUrl': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/favicon.ico', 'sourceHeader': 'murrayscheese.com/wom/holiday-tips-and-faqs', 'title': ""Holiday Tips & FAQs | Murray's Cheese"", 'url': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/wom/holiday-tips-and-faqs'}}}, {'description': 'Provide storage guidelines for different types of cheeses, emphasizing the importance of freshness and optimal consumption.', 'metadata': {'content': ""Storage Tips While harder cheeses can stay fresh for up to two to three weeks when wrapped tightly and unopened, fresh style cheeses are best consumed within a few days.

Inspired by Switzerland’s seasonal Vacherin Mont d’Or, Quinta nails that custardy, spoonable interior. But here the spruce bark wrapper is infused with local bay laurel leaves, so the cheese is both herbaceous and woodsy, with rich notes of buttermilk. The small size makes it a special treat for two, with Rustic Bakery Olive Oil & Sel Gris Flatbread and Trois Petits Cochons Cornichons. Read More “When I can resist eating this straight out of the wheel with a spoon on the couch, it comes with me to every picnic. In the winter, I also like it heated up like a Vacherin Mont d'Or. You can even brûlée the top with sugar!” Murray’s Merchandising – New York, NY Ingredients Cultured Pasteurized Cow'S Milk, Salt, Enzymes More about Point Reyes Mini Quinta Quinta is pronounced KEEN – tuh. It means farmstead in Portuguese, a nod to the Point Reyes owners’ heritage. It also translates to fifth in Spanish, as this is the fifth cheese added to Point Reyes’ core lineup. Point Reyes puts their own stamp on a European classic by steeping the spruce bark in a tea made from bay laurel leaves harvested from their own farm. Each wheel is topped with a bay leaf. The cheese is inspired by Vacherin Mont d’Or, the iconic spruce-wrapped cheese from the Jura mountains along the French-Swiss border. But this is a distinctly American take, the flavor reflecting the terroir of Northern California, where cows enjoy the cool coastal climate and lush green pastures. The steeped bark imparts woodsy and herbaceous notes to the cheese (particularly closer to the rind) while also holding in the increasingly oozy, luscious paste. Mini Quinta is delicious at any age, but its flavor profile will change as it matures. Younger wheels boast more notes of buttermilk and vanilla, while older wheels lean toward cultured butter, wild mushroom, and woodsy aromas.

These days, you can use a\xa0\xa0raclette griller or toaster oven for peak meltiness. Follow our recipe for creating a Raclette board for two . Halloumi : This traditional Greek favorite has been dubbed ‘The Grilling Cheese’ for its unique ability to resist melting at high temps. Its springy, meaty texture and lightly salty flavor make it perfect for serving up with olive oil and roasted veggies on a skewer. Try pan-searing it to get a crisp, mouthwatering exterior. NY State Yellow Cheddar : Crafted from the pasteurized cow’s milk of family farms in upstate New York, this classic cheddar is sweet, milky, and umami-packed, with a bright bite. It melts beautifully, so use it to top off a pan-roasted burger. Maple Leaf Pepper Jack : This American original incorporates fresh red and green jalapeno peppers, adding crunch and spice to the buttery, tangy jack cheese. Creamy with a definite kick, this is just right melted over nachos or burgers – or snacked on with a great, crisp beer to beat the heat.', 'source': {'data': {'base_url': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/wom/journal/hosting-and-entertaining/no-grill-no-problem', 'description': 'Get the best of summer snacking no matter what your grilling set-up looks like!

The cheese paper helps cover the items and stop them from drying out, while also allowing the cheese to breathe. Since cheese is mold, it's a living thing! If you cut off air circulation to the cheese, you can actually cause it to suffocate and spoil at a faster rate. Cheese is best stored in the bottom drawer or vegetable crisper in your fridge. In general, it’s better to buy small amounts of cheese for when you need it rather than trying to make a lot last a long time. While harder cheeses can stay fresh for up to two to three weeks when wrapped tightly and unopened, fresh style cheeses are best consumed within a few days of opening. If your fresh cheese is packed in olive oil or brine, store any leftovers in the liquid and follow package instructions.

Want to keep your fridge stocked with Murray’s top selections? We’ve chosen our favorite long-lasting cheeses and charcuterie, and the kitchen essentials to keep them stored properly. What do all these items have in common? Their age. The longer cheeses (and meats) are aged, the lower their moisture content is, which usually results in a cheese with a firm, crumbly, or even dry, granular texture. Less water means less chance for spoilage, so when looking for cheeses that can stay tasty for a couple weeks (when properly stored), always go for\xa0hard cheeses\xa0and aged varieties. Parmigiano Reggiano This centuries-old Italian classic never goes out of style. Bright, fruity, and nutty, it’s ideal for grating over pastas or salad, or snacking on with a bite of deli meat or a smear of jam. When you’re finally finished with it, keep the rind! Parm rinds are known for adding some seriously rich savor when added to soups, broths, and stews. Roomano If you’ve never tried this extra-aged Gouda, now’s your chance. With notes of salted caramel and sweet butterscotch, it’s the ultimate crowd-pleaser, and a sweet alternative to traditional Dutch varieties. Aged for 3+ years, it’s got a delectably crunchy paste that makes for addictive snacking and is guaranteed to hold up in your refrigerator. Aged Cheddars When stocking up on cheese, cheddar is a go-to for many, but when thinking about longevity, try zeroing in on some popular aged selections–these ones will have a more flaky, crumbly texture and more depth of flavor, leaning towards savory rather than sweet. Some of our favorite aged cheddars?\xa0Milton Creamery Flory’s Truckle,\xa0Neal’s Yard Dairy Montgomery’s Cheddar, and\xa0Quicke’s Mature Cheddar.\xa0Try these in a salad, baked into a tart, or simply paired with a cracker. Salami Grab some meat to go with your cheese! Because charcuterie is cured, most varieties will last longer than any freshly cooked meat you’ve got, but a rustic salami chub is easily the hardiest. Naturally protected by a thick casing, a full salami can last in your fridge just as long as your favorite hard cheeses, making for a quick and easy snack that’s filled with rich and satisfying flavor. The Key to Keeping Cheese Longer: Bees Wax Wraps Our number one rule for storing cheese? Stay away from plastic bags and wraps. The trick to keeping things fresh is to allow the cheese to breathe a little–plastic wrap isn’t ideal because (aside from being hard on the environment) it dries out the remaining moisture in the cheese, which makes it lose its flavor and texture quickly. To keep your cheese in top condition, we love beeswax paper –its porous nature helps the cheese retain moisture and stay fresh, and it’s naturally sustainable.

To differentiate it from Gouda, the bottom of the Roomano wheel is flattened during the aging process.

Read More Ingredients Cow's Milk, Goat's Milk, Sheep's Milk, Salt, Cultures, Enzymes Allergens : Milk More about Old Chatham Creamery 6 Month Gouda Traditional Dutch Gouda is made only with cow’s milk, but American varieties often experiment with different milk types. Each milk type offers something different to the finished cheese—tang from the goat’s milk, fattiness from the sheep’s milk, and body from the cow’s milk. Play up this Gouda’s sweetness with an oatmeal stout or provide some contrast with a spicy red wine like syrah. About the maker For over 25 years, Old Chatham Creamery has produced award-winning, artisan sheep’s, and cow’s milk cheeses and yogurts. Through its fully-integrated operations, Old Chatham uses milk directly from their own flock of sheep and herd of cows. Their interpretations of classic European cheeses, coupled with cutting edge production methods and expert cheesemakers, create classic, flavorful cheeses. Old Chatham has been a consistent collaborator for Murray’s Cavemaster cheeses, not only by providing Camembert and Kinderhook cheeses but also by welcoming Murray’s to their creamery to develop the recipe for the Cavemaster Original 80:10:10 cheese. In fact, Kinderhook became one of Murray’s very first Cavemaster Reserve cheeses: C-Local. Murray’s Stockinghall Cheddar is now made by Old Chatham Creamery.

Read More “Cacio e Pepe' as a flavor (black pepper and some sort of pecorino) seemed to be all over NYC restaurant menus a few years back and that's when I really got into this cheese. There's something magic that happens when you bite into a whole peppercorn in the middle of chewing a smooth creamy mouthful of young pecorino.” Murray’s Wholesale Team – New York, NY Ingredients Pasteurized Sheep's Milk, Rennet, Salt, Black Pepper Allergens : Milk More about Rustico® Black Pepper Rustico Black Pepper is also known as a “young pepato,” which is a type of peppered Italian cheese. It’s made in Tuscany using milk from Sardinia and Sicily. The cheese is semi-soft and aged only five weeks. Black Pepper is indigenous only to Kerala, India, and arrived to the Mediterranean through ancient Roman and Greek trade routes. Rustico Black Pepper combines the main ingredients used in Cacio e Pepe, which makes it perfect for melting over pasta. Storage tips When you receive your cheese, unpack the order and refrigerate the items. We recommend using the cheese paper we send most of our products in to store the cheese. The cheese paper helps cover the items and stop them from drying out, while also allowing the cheese to breathe. Since cheese is mold, it's a living thing! If you cut off air circulation to the cheese, you can actually cause it to suffocate and spoil at a faster rate. found in these collections and recipes The Pickles and Cheese Board The ultimate crunchy blend of tangy pickles and cheese"", 'source': {'data': {'base_url': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/dp/rustico-black-pepper', 'description': 'Rustico Black Pepper is a mild Italian sheep’s milk cheese that’s punctuated by bites of black peppercorns for a mouthful that’s both creamy and zesty.', 'iconUrl': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/favicon.ico', 'og:description': 'Rustico Black Pepper is a mild Italian sheep’s milk cheese that’s punctuated by bites of black peppercorns for a mouthful that’s both creamy and zesty.', 'og:title': ""Rustico Black Pepper - a smooth, mild sheep’s milk cheese with black pepper | Murray's Cheese"", 'sourceHeader': 'murrayscheese.com/dp/rustico-black-pepper', 'url': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/dp/rustico-black-pepper'}, 'description': 'Rustico Black Pepper is a mild Italian sheep’s milk cheese that’s punctuated by bites of black peppercorns for a mouthful that’s both creamy and zesty.', 'iconUrl': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/favicon.ico', 'sourceHeader': 'murrayscheese.com/dp/rustico-black-pepper', 'title': ""Rustico Black Pepper - a smooth, mild sheep’s milk cheese with black pepper | Murray's Cheese"", 'url': 'https://www.murrayscheese.com/dp/rustico-black-pepper'}}}]

White and rindless, many fresh cheeses are often mild and milky—like mozzarella, burrata, and ricotta. Likewise, their creamy cousin fresh chèvre (from the French for goat) is similarly lactic, with distinctive tang and a velvety yet crumbly texture. And while briny feta and squeaky halloumi may look different from the other cheeses we’ve mentioned, they’re also part of the fresh family.

For melting over burgers, incorporating into mac and cheese, or sprinkling over nachos, turn to supple cheeses that are high in moisture—think Italian fontina, mozzarella, or Gruyère. To make toasty cheese the star of your next dish, no bread or chips required, choose a firm cheese like halloumi that holds up to the heat of grilling or pan-frying.

These are off-the-beaten-path picks that melt well , f rom elevated cheddar to stinky gems to Alpine classics , prov ing that all it takes is one transcendent wedge to perk up your grilled cheese. Murray's High Plains Cheddar This cheddar is like your favorite pair of jeans: an elevated everyday staple. High Plains gives you classic cheddar flavor with some of the sweetness of an Alpine-style cheese—an unbeatable combination. That makes for a fully balanced bite. The elevated addition: Three Little Figs Puddletown Pub Chuntey Chällerhocker Chällerhocker is ultra-smooth and rich, especially when melted . Meanwhile, this Alpine’s complex flavor makes it mouth-watering, with notes of toasted almonds, sour cream, onion, and a hint of creamy butterscotch. The elevated addition: Pacific Pickle Works Asparagusto Taleggio Adapted from a recipe dating back to 9th century Italy, this classic washed-rind cheese is rich in history and flavor. Applying heat to washed rind cheeses like Taleggio amps up their meaty flavor (and makes them extra gooey). Keep the rind in for textural complexity! The elevated addition: Sibeiho Boomz Sambal Murray’s Cave Aged Reserve Cornelia We make this buttery cow’s milk cheese in collaboration with Point Reyes Farmstead Creamery. Cornelia melts beautifully thanks to its ideal moisture content. The notes of roasted peanuts and buttered toast are a natural fit for a toasty sandwich. The elevated addition: Blake Hill Preserves Orange & Bourbon Marmalade Pyrenees Truffé Studded with white truffles sourced from Italy, Pyrenees Truffé is a Basque cheese brimming with delicate notes of garlicky umami that come to life when melty and warm. This mountain-born beauty is perfect for a special occasion grilled cheese. The elevated addition: Rovagnati Classic Mortadella\u200b Smoked Mozzarella Murray’s Smoked Mozzarella is a pasta filata -style (stretched curd) cheese, which makes for a great cheese pull. This one has mozza rella’s ooey, gooey factor with a woodsy aroma that works so well with the darker, crunchier bits of toasted bread in a grilled cheese. The elevated addition: Akron Honey Habanero Hot Honey Brie Fermier Coming from a farm in Northern France, Murray’s Brie Fermier contains notes of mushrooms and fresh shucked oysters within its oozy paste. In a sandwich , it’s like baked brie for one, with those buttery, button mushroom flavors oozing into the crisp buttered bread. The elevated addition: Da Morgada Guava Paste More Grilled Cheese Tips & Tricks Feeling adventurous? Combine any of these cheeses to create your own desire flavor profile and figure out what cheeses go together. Layering cheeses can also help you nail the perfect grilled cheese texture , as different ki nds of cheese behave differently when melted. Should you go grated or sliced ? Softer cheeses like brie and Taleggio need to be sliced, as they’re too soft to grate. But for firmer cheeses like cheddar, gouda , or Gruyère , grat ing the cheese can create a more even mel t.
